# Note Representation in a Classical Approach

Developed through CS 449 Deep Learning at Northwestern University.

* classic-notegen represents and generates notes in the style of monophonic classical music

* classic-notegen employs traditional deep learning processes of convolution, quantization, and transposed convolution

* classic-notegen novelly introduces Introspection in the learning objective, a counterpart to classical Reconstruction
